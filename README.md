## GFX
A simple retained mode graphics-API, still very much a work in progress 

<sup>*the name even more so*</sup>

Currently the two supported rendering backends are:

- Terminal rendering using **ncurses** 
- GL-window rendering using **GLFW**

### Setup
1. Install **ncurses** or **GLFW** as needed
2. `cd` to main source directory
3. `mkdir build`
4. `cd build`
5. `cmake ..`
6. `make`
7. `cd bin`
7. `./[name-of-demo]`
